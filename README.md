## Comments

I am going to just drop few lines about the development status of this library I am developing.

* I am soon going to expand the library by adding functions that estimate VAR and VECM models, including a function that performs the Johansen cointegration test.
  Note that there are already two functions that are instrumental for that test.
* Part of this library *heavily* draws from the [Spatial Econometrics Toolbox](http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/) that James LeSage made available to everybody on his webpage.
  I find his work wonderful and deeply inspiring.
* I am going to write a "proper" landing page (i.e., this README file) sooner or later.
  It is just not my focus as the moment.
* When I will have time, I will upload some material as a wiki, so to drive the casual users that might be approaching my library for the first time.
  For now, I will just suggest readers to look at the (incomplete) docstrings, which explain the general scopes of the functions, along with a description of what are the input parameters.
